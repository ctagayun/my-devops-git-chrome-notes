      Reference: https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests

      - go to github and navigate to the origin/main in this case the name of my 
        my project is the-road-to-next-app-pro-main

      - Click "Pull Request" in the main menu bar --> and click "New pull request" button
        located in upper right corner of the pull request page.
        A pull request is a proposal to merge a set of changes from one branch into another.

        Note: 
           You can create pull requests on GitHub.com, with GitHub Desktop, in GitHub Codespaces, on GitHub Mobile, 
           and when using GitHub CLI.
       
       - From Pull request page: 
          - under "base" textbox, select base target or the object you want to merge your code into. In this case "main"
          - under "compare" textbox, select "2025-06_solution_autosignin_and_new_changepassword" branch

      - After initializing a pull request, you'll see a review page that shows a high-level overview of the changes 
      between your branch (the compare branch) and the repository's base branch. You can add a summary of the 
      proposed changes, review the changes made by commits, add labels, milestones, and assignees, 
      and @mention individual contributors or teams.  

      - Compare changes. Compare changes across branches, commits, tags, and more below. If you need to, you can also .
      compare across forks.   

         Example of comparisons: 
              the-road-to-next-app-pro-main is the base branch in this case
              
              "2025-06_solution_autosignin_and_new_changepassword" branch ( my branch is the compare branch)
