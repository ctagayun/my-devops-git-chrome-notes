  How to Create a Devops Project 
  ===============================================

  ===============================================
  How To Add New VS Solution to a Devops (Formerly VSTS) Project 
  ===============================================
    - navigate to a project (ex. Securing Azure App)
    - on to top of the menu bar click create a repository. or click Plus Sign --> New Repository
      or for newly created project --> click Plus sign next to project name
    - enter repo name "AddressBookPlusAfterMSI"
    - click create 

    - then  go to Visual Studio -> Team services --> Manage Connection 
      --> Connect to the project (select the repo you created in devops in this case MyAddressBookPlusafterMSI)
      --> a dialog pops up
      --> Click browse Path button (located in the lower right corner ofthe dialog) 
      --> navigate to C:\localdev (my folder containing all apps checked in to Devops)
      --> then click "Make New Folder"  name it "AddressBookafterMsi" 
      --> click ok to create folder 
      --> click "Clone" in the dialog box

    - navigate to the folder that you just created (at this point it is already  git repository)
     (copy and existing solution if that's what you want )
     or run Visual studio as administrator and create a new project

    - After successfully creating the project check it in

   How to see list of Visual Studio Projects in a Devops Project 
     - Click devop project (e.g. MyProject)
     - click "Repos" on the left navbar 
     - click dropdpwn in the menu bar (next to search box)

 GIT - DISTRIBUTED VERSION CONTROL
 Note: Check out GitHub and Git Setup and Essentials (Very Helpful)
       https://www.robinwieruch.de/git-essential-commands/

1. INITIALIZE A REPOSITORY WITH GIT AND GITHUB
     cd C:\_AMyReactDev\my-first-react-project> 

     git init
     touch .gitignore

     - gitignore will ignore certain files which should not be added to remote repo.
       For example you may want to ignore the .env file where you store sensitive
       environment variables of your project or the node_modules/ folder for not uploading 
       all your project dependencies to your remote GitHub repository. 
          .env 
          node_modules/   

2. After you have used the git init command in your local project, you can create a
repository:
    (1) On GitHub. There you can give it a name, an optional description and license (e.g. MIT). 
           Note: Don't use the checkbox for adding a README.md. Instead, leave the 
           checkbox unchecked. Otherwise, if you check the checkbox, you will have a 
           ready to go remote repository therefore do a "CLONE" to your local 
           machine by doing 
               git clone <repository_url> to your local machine.

         Then you get the instructions to link your local repository to your remote repository 
         in the next step.

   (2) Creating a new repository on the command line: 
      echo "# my-first-react-project-" >> README.md
      git init
      git add README.md
      git commit -m "first commit"
      git branch -M main
      git remote add origin https://github.com/ctagayun/my-devops-git-chrome-notes.git
      git push -u origin main

3. How would you get your changes from a local repository to the remote repository? There are three 
essential commands: add, commit, push.

    First, you can either add all or only selected changed files for the next commit.
      git add .  (this adds all files in the local repo)
      git status (always verify with git status")

      git add <path/to/file> (this only add selected files)

      git reset HEAD <path/to/file> (will unstage .add files)

    Second, you can commit the staged files with a commit that comes with a commit message.
       git commit -m "<message>"

    Third:
       Now, before you get to the third step, multiple commits can accumulate in your 
       local repository. Eventually, in the third step, you would push all the commits 
       in one command to the remote repository.

      git push origin master  (is pushing the code to the master branch)
      git push origin main (is pushing the code to the main branch)

         Origin - is the name of the remote repository.
         Master / Main -  is the name of the branch. Both are the names of branches 
                          on a repository on Git.
         Suppose you have name dev as branch name then you need to use that name like :  
           git push origin dev

      Note:
         These are the three necessary steps to get your changes from your 
         local repository to the remote repository. But when you collaborate 
         with others, there can be an intermediate step before you PUSH your changes. 

         Thus, you would have to pull all the changes from the remote repository before 
         you are allowed to push your own changes. It can be simple as that:

      git pull origin master (However, I never pull directly. Instead, I pull rebase:)
         git pull --rebase origin master

    Difference between pull and pull rebase? 
     - A basic git pull would simply put all the changes from the remote repository 
       on top of your changes.

     - With a pull rebase, it is the other way around. The changes from the remote 
       repository come first, then your changes will be added on top. Essentially 
       a pull rebase has two benefits:

       (1) it keeps an ordered git history, because your changes are always 
           added last 
       (2) it helps you to resolve conflicts, if you run into them,
           because you can adjust your own changes more easily
         
       If you have changed but uncommited files when you pull from the remote repository, 
       you are asked to stash your changed files first. After you have pulled all the 
       changes, you can apply the stash again. Stashing will be explained later 
       in the article.

How to create a development branch
1. open command prompt and navigate to folder containing .sln
   Ex. cd C:\_dev1-Api-Dockx\NetCoreApi-Dockx\Validation-And-Logging

2. Execute the following command:
    git checkout -b development //create a local branch called "development"
    git push origin development //push the new branch into the server

3. go to VSTS. Select Code --> Branch to see brance you just created.

=======================================================
How to create a feature branch
1. Bring up the cloned visualstudio Solution
2. Go to DevOps and click the active repository Ex. demo-git-repo
3. Right click "Development" branch or "Master" if no developmemt branch
   and select "New Local Branch" --> enter name of branch in the dialog 
   (for example Branch-A) and then check "Checkout Branch" checkbox. 

4. Click "Create Branch" button to create the branch

5. Double click the created branch to make it the active branch.
   In the lower right corner of Visual Studio you should see the name of the
   repository and the active branch. Example:
      "demo-git-repo"  "Branch-A"

6. Next right click the newly created branch and select "Push Branch"
   so that the branch will be copied in "remotes/origin" . Expand
   remotes/origin to see "Branch-A" the branch you just created.

7. Note: To delete the branch, delete the branch in the "remotes/origin"
   folder in Team Explorer --> right click -- > "delete branch from remote"

   To verify it is deleted in remote, go to DevOps --> code --> Branches

   

=======================================================
How to save changes to files under a given branch. 
You can do this as many times you want. When you are satisfied with
the changes save them in Gitby doing COMMIT.

1. double click the branch to make it the current branch
2. Make your changes (as many times you want). When you are satisfied,
   do a commit. 
3. Go to Team Explorer ---> click the "House" icon
4. Select "Changes" button 
5. You will see the list of files you changed.
5. Optional: If you want to associate a work item in this
   commit --> click "Plus" sign under "Related WOrk Items" -->
   enter ID of related work item and click --> "Add"

6. Finally enter comments and click "Commit All"

   To make the changes you made to the files available to 
   the server, do the following:
      - go to Team Explorer --> House Icon --> Sync
      - select "Pull" or "Fetch" and then "Pull" under "Incoming Commits"
      - fimally click "Push" under "Outgoing Commits" to complete te sync

===========================================================
Doing a PULL request.
After doing a Commit, Sync and Push for the branch you changes are now
in the server. Do a pull request to ask somebody to review your code:

To create  a "Pull Request" 
1. Go to VSTS --> Code --> Pull Requets
2. Select "New Pull Request" button
3. Select the branch from the dropdown box
4. Select the branch want to merge into from the dropdown box:
     Master or Development
5. Enter "Title" and description
6. Under "Reviewers" select the name of the programmer 
   you want to review your code
  
7. Search for work item related to this Pull Request.
8. Click Create
   (Below the create button. You will see the changes you made in each file.)


================================================================
You can review comments made on your PULL request by going to VSTS Project page.
Once all changes are approved

==================================================================================================

1. Creating Branch in Visual Studio:
    - bring up the clones VS Solution
    - click "Active Repository" in Team Explorer
    - right clcik "master" and select "New Local Branch From" (in this case "master") give it a name like "UpdSubModelVerbiage"
    - Click "Create"
    - Double click the newly created branch so that changes you make will recorded under this branch.
      You should see the selected branch opposite the active repositiory like this:
          Example:
             Apd.Vis.UI (UpdSubmodelVerbiage)

    
    CREATING BRANCH IN THE WEB: https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/git/create-branch
        - from team project select the "Code" view. MAKE SURE YOU ARE WORKING WITH THE RIGHT REPO (EX. Apd.Vis.UI, Apd.Vis.Web)
        - click "Branches"
        - select the "New Branch" button
        - in the "Create Branch" dialog enter:
            - name of new branch you want 
            - in the dropdown box select based on: select "master"
            - in the "WorkItems to link" dropdown, select the appropriate work item.
            - click "create Branch" button

        - then go to Visual Studio Team Explorer
            - select origin/master and do a fetch. This will bring the branch to your origin/remote
            - double click the new branch you created in the web in order to copy it in your local repositiory

        - then go to local repo and double click it (THIS WILL MAKE THE NEW BRANCH AS THE CURRENT BRANCH)





2. Make changes to your file

   - if you want to see the files affected by yourchanges, click on home icon and select "Changes"

3. SAVE CHANGES (YOU CAN DO THIS AS MANY TIMES AS YOU WANT). When you are satisfied with the changes, save them in 
   Git by doing a "Commit".  To do that, do the following:
    - Click Home --> Changes  
    - right click the files and  select " Staged"
    - Enter description of changes
    - then click "Commit Staged"

4. SHARING YOUR CHANGES:
    - CLICK "Home" icon
    - select "sync"
    - select "Push"

5. OPEN PULL REQUESTS AND CLICK "NEW PULL REQUEST"
    - select the local source branch ex. UpdSubmodelVerbiage
    - Verify the remote branch to to MERGE into. (Is it Default Brance or Master???)
    - enter change description
    - click "Create"

6. YOU CAN REVIEW COMMENTS MADE ON YOUR PULL REQUEST BY GOING TO THE Visual Studio Team Project page.
   Omce all changes are approved by the team, DO A PULL REQUEST


7. SYNC WITH OTHERS:
    - This the process of getting changes from others to keep your code up to date. You pull commits
      made by others and merge them into your branch.
    - sometimes you might get "Merge Conflict" which you need to resolve "manually" or automatically"

    - STEPS IN SYNCHRONIZATION:
        - CLICK  "SYNC"
        - you will see list of incoming commits
        - click "pull" or Fetch" - not SURE
