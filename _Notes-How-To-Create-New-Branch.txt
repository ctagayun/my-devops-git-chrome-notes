1. From windows terminal 
    cd C:\_AMyReactPro\the-road-to-next-app-pro-main

    To create a new branch: 
       - git checkout -b new-branch-name main
         This creates a new branch called "new-branch-name" and 
         switches you to the this new branch.

       - alternatively git checkout -b branch-name origin/branch-name
         then do git switch branch-name

     To push the new branch to GitHub, use      

       git push -u origin new-branch-name

       Output:
           Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0 (from 0)
            remote:
            remote: Create a pull request for 'new-branch-name' on GitHub by visiting:
            remote:      https://github.com/ctagayun/the-road-to-next-app-pro-main/pull/new/new-branch-name
            remote:
            To https://github.com/ctagayun/the-road-to-next-app-pro-main.git
            * [new branch]      new-branch-name -> new-branch-name
            branch 'new-branch-name' set up to track 'origin/new-branch-name'.

  2.  Alternatively, on GitHub.com:

        Go to the repository page (the-road-to-next-app-pro-main).
        Click the Branch: main dropdown near the top left.
        Type your new branch name into the field.
        Click Create branch: new-branch-name from 'main'.

  3. To Delete a branch: 
      
      To delete a branch on GitHub, you have two main options: using the GitHub web interface
      or using Git commands.

        Deleting a Branch via GitHub Web Interface:
           Go to your repository on GitHub.
           Click on the "Branches" tab (usually found above the file list or under "Code").
           Find the branch you want to delete (not the default branch, e.g., not main/master).
           Click the trash can icon (üóëÔ∏è) next to the branch name to delete it.


        Deleting a Branch via Git Command Line:
           Open your terminal or command prompt.

           First delete a branch locally:

           git branch -d new-branch-name
             Use -D instead of -d if you want to force delete (e.g., git branch -D branch-name).

           Next delete a branch on remote (e.g., GitHub):
           git push origin --delete branch-name

        Note:

        You cannot delete the branch you are currently checked out to; switch to another branch first.
        Deleting a branch is irreversible, so make sure you don‚Äôt need it anymore.

   4. To modify a branch in Git (and on Github) 

      -  git checkout branch-name
