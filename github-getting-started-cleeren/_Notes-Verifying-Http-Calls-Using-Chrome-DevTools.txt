2. Making a POST request
     - https://app.pluralsight.com/ilx/video-courses/d5d30ea4-0af1-447a-b13a-e60a095337a6/779c97bc-43ab-42d0-8226-72c993410f5c/52d915c2-26f3-41ee-ab9c-c6ba60d982b5

     - modify src/app/CartService. Add a method called "add() (see comments in the source code )
       This method will add a product to the Cart in the server
     - now test the app:
         do nmp start on api-server
         do npm start on the src/ website
       click "buy" on any of the products

       do f12 --> Fetch/XHR --> click the request called "cart" displayed on the left pane
          --> click "Payload" menu item (it will show data being added)
          --> go to localhost:8081/api/cart to see the product being added
