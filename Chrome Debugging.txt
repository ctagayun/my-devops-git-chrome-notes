1. Console Tab - first place to look for errors

2. Elements Tab - this is a depiction of the DOM. 
     - it represents the HTML as node tree where each node is a part of our HTML

     - notice the <script>. These aren't in our source index.html. We'll talk about it later 
       in this course.

     - <pm-root ng-version-14.0.3"> ...(</pm-root>) this is our selector tag and you will see the 
       HTML defined in our component template

3. Sources Tab 
     - there's a debugger option available 
     - For Angular Only 
        - since Angular CLI uses webpack, our typescript files are listed under 
          the webpack node. And because Anglar CLI serve features generates the map files, we can debug 
          our TypeScript code directly.

        - navigate to webpack:// --> src --> app --> app.component --> set a breakpont on "PageTitle
          and click refresh --> break will be hit

     - Debugger shortcuts: 
          F8 = resume script. 
          F9 = Step
          F10 = step over next function call
          F11 = step into next function call
          Shift + F11 = step out of current function

4. Network Tab
    - enable  "preserve log" 
    - enable "All"
